 Make a Website Mobile-Friendly Using CSS Media Queries
We used a CSS media query with @media (max-width: 768px) to apply specific styles when the screen width is 768 pixels or less, which typically includes tablets and mobile devices. Inside this query, we changed the layout of the input group from a horizontal row to a vertical stack, making the input box and add button take up the full width of their container for easier use on smaller screens. We also removed flexible sizing to avoid layout problems and increased the buttonâ€™s padding to improve touch accessibility. Additionally, the container width was adjusted to be more fluid and fit well on mobile devices. Overall, these changes ensure the website looks good and functions smoothly across different screen sizes, making it mobile-friendly and responsive.
